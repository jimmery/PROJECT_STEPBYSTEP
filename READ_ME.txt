Hello reader!

Welcome to our small project. Right now, we're trying to do small projects to improve our competence in programming and application development.
Our current plans are to try web development and see how that works out. 
Our current schedule is every Friday at 9PM. We may change this or add times as we see fit.

Thanks for joining us on our journey,
Arkadip Saha, Co-Founder
Jeffrey Jiang, Co-Founder
